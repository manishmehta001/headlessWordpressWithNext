Headless WordPress with Next.js Application:-
---------------------------------------------
headlessWordpressWithNext is a learning and demonstration project that showcases the use of a Headless WordPress architecture. The main objective is to understand how WordPress can be used as a backend Content Management System (CMS) while building the frontend with the modern Next.js framework.
This architecture is ideal for developers who want to learn the JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) approach and explore headless CMS concepts.

Key Features:-
--------------
WordPress (Backend):
-------------------
Headless setup with WordPress REST API enabled.
Integration with Custom Post Types and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for dynamic content.
Secure content management with user roles (Admin, Editor, Author).

Next.js (Frontend):
Dynamic page rendering using getStaticProps and getServerSideProps for optimal SEO and performance.
API Routes to fetch data from the WordPress REST API.
Clean and modern UI built with TailwindCSS or Material UI.
React Query or SWR for efficient data fetching and caching.
Client-side routing using Next.js Router.

Deployment Ready:-
-------------------
Frontend easily deployable on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
WordPress backend can be self-hosted or deployed on managed platforms such as Pantheon or WP Engine.

Core Technologies:-
------------------
Backend:-
--------
WordPress CMS with REST API capabilities.
Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for custom data structures.
JWT Authentication (optional) for secure APIs.

Frontend:-
---------
Next.js (React framework for Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation).
TailwindCSS / Material UI for modern styling.
SWR / React Query for efficient data fetching and state management.
Axios or fetch for API calls.
Framer Motion for smooth animations.

Project Highlights:-
-------------------
A learning-focused project designed to understand the Headless CMS architecture.
Demonstrates the separation of content management (WordPress) from the presentation layer (Next.js).
SEO-friendly static and server-rendered pages with Next.js.
Scalable and secure design for future extensions.
Developer-friendly structure with reusable components and dynamic routing.
